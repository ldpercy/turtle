Show click commands
===================

*Present the commands generated by mouse clicks in the UI*


Currently the mouse click events just happen, but they're all generating move/draw commands of some sort under the hood, so it would be nice to see what's being generated.

For example if there was a draw sequence you were interested in, you could copy it out and move it to the command box for editing.

Plus hopefully when the arithmetic get a bit more settled, command synonyms or equivalents.
