Have multiple turtles on the page.

I'd considered this a while back, and have just recently cleaned up the turtle css a bit to try out drawing the ninja turtles, so am thinking about how it could be done.

Also trying to get to the bottom of some `use` related issues (there are browser differences), beginning with web-components & shadow-dom, and toying with making page items selectable.

So multi-turtle is simmering in my brain at the moment, for now this will just be a drop off point off for ideas.


Initial Thoughts
----------------

* Keyboard or UI controls to add/remove turtles
* Each turtle has own name, appearance, draw color, other properties
* Initially all on the same page, but separate pages should be possible down the line
* The ability to select turtles would be needed
* Center turtle would have to be rehomed with the turtle controls (from the page form) - you could add an 'average' for the page I suppose
* Page rotation would probably have to belong to the turtle as well - again an 'average' could be doable, might be strange though
* Consider turning the turtles into web-components??

Early experiments with focus for the turtle have been mixed.
