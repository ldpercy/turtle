Polar grid
----------

The first worry that pops into my head is which angular units to show... will get degrees going first.

Will do this programmatically, might as well update the cartesian grid while I'm at it.

Actually doing this programmatically will mean i get to stop using the pattern to draw the grid, which could well end up faster/lighter.
