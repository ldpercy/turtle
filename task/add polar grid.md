The first worry that pops into my head is which angular units to show... will get degrees going first.

Will do this programmatically, might as well update the cartesian grid while I'm at it.

### Cartesian grid

Actually doing this programmatically will mean i get to stop using the pattern to draw the grid, which could well end up faster/lighter.
Just done; on my desktop ff the grid rendering is noticeably faster/cleaner - there was a bit of lag for the antialiasing here previously.
