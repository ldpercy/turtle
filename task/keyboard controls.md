Keyboard controls
=================

Same caveats as I had for year-clock, but am interested in adding a few keyboard controls here.
(Same issues also with inputs and focus.)

For example:
	d		- do
	c		- clear
	o		- origin
	m		- marker
	+/-		- zoom
	del		- undo last


Note that 'c' has three initial candidates - clear, center turtle, cartesian - so need to figure those out.


There was also an idea I had ages ago to preprogram some moves into the arrow keys and use them to move the turtle around.
Given how complex turtle/point arithmetic is starting to look, might want to hold off a tad on this one.
But not necessarily a bad idea.
