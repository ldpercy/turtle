Ideas:
* Create a settings structure for the command box, page and drawing settings
* Save the settings when the page visibility changes (~unload)
* Load the settings on page load
* Possibly have separate light and dark mode settings for the grids, colour and stroke width
* Multiple command buffers - be able to switch between a few command sets (also saved)
