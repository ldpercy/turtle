Fix Angles 🛠⦬
==============

There are a few small angle quirks cropping up, not bugs per se, just not-ideal.

* The presentation of angles in reports and the point info is generally fairly inconsistent
* Angles calculated using `getAngleFrom` don't take the current direction into account

The second is the main one i'm interested in right now, and should be fairly easy to sort out.

Some of the presentation stuff might need to be deferred to the planned space improvements as it will largely depend on that.
Might be be able to wodge some things in now though.


Representation and 'true' angles
--------------------------------

Angles are usually represented in degrees as 0-360 or +/-180.
And by adding (or subtracting) multiples of 360 you can generated infinite apparent equivalents for any given angle.

But they are only synonyms from a presentation or resultant point of view - actual angles beyond 360 represent winding or turns.
So 360 is one turn, 720 is two turns etc and the distinction is important in many sports, skateboarding for example.

The turtle's direction (or heading) is a true angle and needs to preserve winding.

So I need to make sure I have a clear separation between:
* true angles
* apparent or presentational angles

And that the correct maths is applied in the correct spots.

Some of this will vary on things like
* How the space is configured - clockwise/ccw
* The needs of the particular calculation
* User/UI preferences


What needs looking at
---------------------

The core method here is `PlanarSpace.getAngleFrom` which is the *only* place I'm calling `Math.atan2`.

Currently it's returning one positive quadrant and three negative quadrants, so for starters I'll normalise that to +/-180.


* I've added a `normalise` mutator to the planar space angles to reduce them down to -180 < a < 180


`move(dx, dy)` and `moveToXYwithRotate` both now use reduced deltas to generate their new angles so the movement is a lot more fluid and realistic now.

Winding up and and down the rotation with those techniques also works as expected now.
I should check to make sure the other commands also correctly add and subtract deltas to preserve rotations.

Also the page rotation isn't always using the full winding, but not sure if I necessarily always want it to - the case could be made for either.
Hmm actually it seems like the page winding has stopped altogether now...
Not sure why yet - the rotate transform on the page is still measuring in the hundreds or thousands sometimes.


### Rotate transform

* If you take the rotate transform off the svg element entirely the page does a minimal rotation to get back to alignment - this happens when you uncheck 'rotate page'
* If you instead set it to zero it does a full unwind (if needed) - this happens when you click 'to origin'

So at the moment then the only time it's doing a full unwind is when you click 'to origin'.

Will review which behaviour I want.

*Additional* It's also dependent on whether 'center turtle' is checked - when unchecked it does full winds, when checked it does not


Probably wrap soon, as the main issue is resolved.
