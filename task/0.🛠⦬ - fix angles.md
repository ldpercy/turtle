Fix Angles 🛠⦬
==============

There are a few small angle quirks cropping up, not bugs peer se, just no-ideal.

* The presentation of angles in reports and the point info is generally fairly inconsistent
* Angles calculated using `getAngleFrom` dont take the current direction into account

The second is the main one i'm interested in right now, and should be fairly easy to sort out.

Some of the presentation stuff might need to be deferred to the planned space improvements as it will largely depend on that.
Might be be able to wodge some things in now though.
