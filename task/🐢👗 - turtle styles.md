This will be a bit of a random collection of things - some experiments, some improvements, some new stuff.

* Make the turtle look a little 'happier' esp when enlarged - at the moment he has a pretty dead stare
* Create a version of the graphic without all the css calcs
* See if zoom can be done with a simple transform instead of the css var calcs
* Add bandanas to the ninja turtles
* Experiment with some simple animations
* Improve the help dialog backdrop
* Some general CSS clean up
* Etc....
