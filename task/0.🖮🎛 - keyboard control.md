Keyboard controls
=================


Add some keyboard controls for the Turtle ui.

Same caveats as I had for year-clock, but am interested in adding a few keyboard controls here.
(Same issues also with inputs and focus.)

For example:
	d		- do
	c		- clear
	o		- origin
	m		- marker
	+/-		- zoom
	del		- undo last


Note that 'c' has three initial candidates - clear, center turtle, cartesian - so need to figure those out.


There was also an idea I had ages ago to preprogram some moves into the arrow keys and use them to move the turtle around.
Given how complex turtle/point arithmetic is starting to look, might want to hold off a tad on this one.
But not necessarily a bad idea.


Starting ideas
--------------

There are some keys I should probably be pretty hesitant about mapping outright such as del, home and backspace.
Pretty sure backspace as 'navigate back' is deprecated these days, but some browsers might still use it.

The couple of keyboard controls I added into year-clock were done very quickly, and I have had some ideas about how I mgiht do it better now:
* Filter out keypress events on known input types such as textareas, date inputs etc
* Have a keyboard mode toggle switch in the UI
* Only register keyboard listeners on the SVG element itself, not the whole document

The last will probably be the simplest.
Some sort of way of indicating what has focus might be nice though.


### Keyboard API

I should review this, it's marked as experimental but looks to have fairly solid browser support?:

Not sure if its new or just some parts are updated.


### Registering keyboard events

On that topic, I've been thinking about how to do it, and in the 'old' way of doing things i'd need two layers of registration i think.
A primary for the generic keydown, then a secondary to farm out the individual keys to their respective handlers.
