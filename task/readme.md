Task
====




Todo:
-----

* Ability to switch between SVG and conventional coordinates (`y` up/down)
* Work out how to apply different transition speeds to different items
* Find out what's going on with the turtle animation to/from the origin - it moves weirdly for those
* Add SVG arc command - might be tricky to do nicely
* Add colour commands for turtle to override defaults
* Add fill colour picker
* Vastly improve floating-point handling - snapping, rounding, comparison, precision etc
* Add a polar grid or overlay option
* Change or have options for line drawing - line, polygon, path


### In Progress

* Conversion to conventional cartesian coordinates
* Page zooming with scale transform (better than viewBox resize)


### Done

* Add unit labels to the axis lines
* Rotate the page according to the turtle's perspective
* Add turtle-centering transform
* Split this repo from experiment-svg
