Cartesian Coordinates
=====================


At the moment everything is using [standard SVG coordinates](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorials/SVG_from_scratch/Positions#the_grid>) which inverts `y` compared to the way cartesian coordinates are usually presented.


Want to add some sort of way to switch the display into a conventional cartesian mode.
