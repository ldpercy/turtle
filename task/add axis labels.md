Add axis labels
================

Really quick little job, add some labels to axes to show positive and negative directions.
At the moment everything is in SVG units so it won't be obvious to casual users.

I've added some in by hand, but they should probably be drawn programmatically in future.
Particularly when I get conventional cartesian coordinates going.
