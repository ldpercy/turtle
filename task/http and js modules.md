HTTP and JS modules
===================


Probably do this one before year-clock, as it's smaller and more contained, and the code is generally in a better state.

I'm not sure yet how much of my class-based code will look strange in the module-based world.
A certain amount of it was kind of a workaround for creating namespaces, but some is still legit i think.
