HTMLApp
-------

I've converted the main page script over to become an HTMLApp, a little class I'm experimenting with to organise some common features such as event registration.

Still really early days so will see how it pans out, but has some advantages like not polluting the global 'window' namespace.

Registering event functions inside the instance requires a couple of tricks though:
```js
{
	query: '#input-do',
	type: 'click',
	listener: ()=>this.doCommands
},
```
I haven't figured out yet how to do this raw, ie `listener: this.doCommands`.
I faced the same issue in year-clock and this was the only way that seemed to work... will keep experimenting.
Like this you have to evaluate the function to get the actual listener though.
```js
listenerFunction.bind(this)
```
By default event listeners receive the originating element as 'this' which isn't all that useful a lot of the time.
For now I'm binding the listener 'this' to the instance 'this' which makes things easier in a class context.
However i can think of cases where the element is needed - I'm using it in year-clock for example - so might have to have an alternate solution for those.
I could probably create a synonym for 'this' for listeners to use, but would require separating listeners and handler functions.

As I say, early days so open to improvements.




Colour scheme
-------------

I have a quick knocked together light-dark switcher going, but there are some immediate problems which will require a bit more research.

Main thing are browser-native widgets like buttons, textareas, checkboxes etc.

I need to see if there's a way to manually switch into the browser's dark/light modes as well so I can use its dark widget styles.

Okay that wasn't difficult - these will set the scheme styles for things like native form widgets:
```css
	color-scheme: light;
	color-scheme: dark;
```


Wrapup
------

There are a few extra bits and pieces that could be done here, but this is 95% of what i want for now.

* Converted main page scripts to early version of HTMLApp that I'm experimenting with.
* Turned off scrollbars - improves presentation on Chromium a bit, but there are 5 extra pixels that I still can't account for
* Added scheme switcher and some basic light/dark css changes


These follow ups can all come later:

* The 5 extra vertical pixels
* Add automatic scheme selection based on the user's preference
* The commands box flashes white in ff after a dark reload - find out what's causing that
* A little extra polish in general
* See if I can use browser storage or similar to maintain some settings, esp the command box for Chrome
