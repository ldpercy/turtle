Terminology
===========



Space
-----

An abstract geometric space the turtle moves in.

For most purposes this will be a familiar two dimensional euclidean plane (called "PlanarSpace" in the code).

Point
-----

A location in a space.

In two dimensions a point can be described with either a cartesian x,y or a polar r,a pair.

Position
--------

A position combines a location (point) and a direction/orientation (angle).

Anything that is orientable such as the turtle has a *position*, not just a location (point).
